      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>A Little Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm <strong>Aiman</strong>, currently pursuing a degree in IT
        with a focus on Software Engineering. I like coding but I'm still a
        beginner. I have a genuine passion for technology, which extends to
        repairing and exploring all things tech-related.
      </p>
      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy unwinding by catching up on
        sleep, indulging in anime, and occasionally playing my favorite mobile
        games. Admittedly, my design skills are a work in progress, as
        creativity isn't my strong suit. However, I'm committed to refining my
        abilities and contributing meaningfully to the field of technology.
      </p>
